### Porject: The structural change in UK generation mix

This project uses KMeans clustering analysis to analyse UK generation mix data and search for the structural change in UK generation mix.
The data is downloaded from the [National Energy System Operator (NESO)](https://www.neso.energy/data-portal)

This repository contains three scripts:

1. The [first notebook](https://github.com/chihyuehhuang/UK_generation_mix_change/blob/main/notebooks/01_data_import%20(first).ipynb) downloads the data via NESO API and export it to PostgreSQL database.
2. The [second notebook](https://github.com/chihyuehhuang/UK_generation_mix_change/blob/main/notebooks/02_data_update.ipynb) updates the database.
However, it is not necessary to frequently update the data, as the main purpose is to find the long-term structural change.
3. The [third notebook](https://github.com/chihyuehhuang/UK_generation_mix_change/blob/main/notebooks/03_clustering_analysis.ipynb) performs the clustering analysis.
It includes data preprocessing, analysis and findings.
